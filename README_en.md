# 2023 Multiplayer Release Conference
Preface:
The production of SC 2.2API Chinese multiplayer version officially started in January 2021, and a multiplayer production team was established with Xiaoxiao and lixue as the core. After a long period of development and testing, after fixing multiple serious bugs that affect survival, the production team believes that the time to release multiplayer is ripe, but it does not mean there are no bugs. If you are not satisfied, please turn right to MC multiplayer. Multiplayer still has a long way to go, and the production team is currently fully committed to fixing bugs. We hope everyone will maintain a positive attitude and witness the growth of SC multiplayer together.

Version Description:
There are many multiplayer versions currently. This post only explains the multiplayer version released by the SC Chinese community. Multiplayer is developed based on API 1.32, and the game version is 2.2, but it has synchronized some game content of 2.3, including archive optimization and audio repair, and can be played as 2.3. There are Android and computer versions, HarmonyOS is also available, but there is no iOS version, and some Android devices may not be supported.
As an independent API, multiplayer may open mod interfaces later. Although some mods can be used now, generally speaking, multiplayer does not support mods temporarily, and it is not recommended to try.

Multiplayer Rules:
For public servers, in order to maintain the game environment, the following rules are specially formulated. We hope all players will consciously abide by them. Severe violations will be considered to take compulsory measures to prohibit the game.
1. Unite and love, help each other.
2. It is forbidden to demolish or destroy other players' buildings without their consent.
3. It is forbidden to maliciously lag the server, blow up the server, attack, etc. in any form.
4. It is forbidden to make inappropriate remarks or build buildings that do not conform to three views.
5. Do not rummage through or steal other people's items without consent.
6. Do not use terrain destruction tools on the surface, such as explosive barrels.
7. Forbidden malicious PvP.
8. Please report bugs in time for processing.
The rules are tentative and will be adjusted according to the actual situation later. Please also pay attention to the rules set by the server provider.
